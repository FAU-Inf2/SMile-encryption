About Us
--------------------------------
SMile Cryptographic Extension (SMileCE) is a mobile application developed by students during the course "Mobile Application Development" (MAD) at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany.

It is a plugin for our mail application [SMile](https://github.com/FAU-Inf2/SMile/) to be able to send and recieve S/MIME encrypted mails. SMileCE provides a variety of useful features like listing imported certificates, show additional information of the certificates and create own self-signed certificates.

SMileCE is developed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
It is open source because we think this is the only way security software should be developed. We encourage you to follow our project on GitHub.
